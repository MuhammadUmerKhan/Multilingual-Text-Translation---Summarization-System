![Translation & Summarization](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Translation_Process.svg/1200px-Translation_Process.svg.png)

## 📜 Overview

The **Multilingual Text Translation & Summarization System** is an AI-powered tool designed to:
- Translate text between multiple languages with high accuracy.
- Summarize long paragraphs or uploaded documents into concise versions.

The project leverages state-of-the-art **pretrained transformer models** for both translation and summarization tasks. It is deployed as a user-friendly **Streamlit web application** and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In a globalized world, overcoming **language barriers** and extracting meaningful insights from text is a major challenge.

### Challenges Addressed:
- **Accurate multilingual translation** across various languages.
- **Efficient summarization** of long-form text and documents.
- **User-friendly interface** for real-time processing.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ **Translation Pipeline:**
- Uses **Facebook's M2M100** model (`facebook/m2m100_418M`), which supports **multiple languages**.
- Tokenizes the input text and processes it through a transformer-based model.

### 2️⃣ **Summarization Pipeline:**
- Uses **BART-based text summarization** (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`).
- Supports long text summarization while maintaining coherence and context.

### 3️⃣ **User Interface:**
- Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.
- Provides options to select input and target languages.
- Enables file upload for summarization.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project

The system will launch a **web app** where users can:
1. **Select a source language** and input text for translation.
2. **Choose the target language** for translation.
3. **Upload a file or enter text** for summarization.
4. **Click "Translate" or "Summarize"** to get results instantly.
